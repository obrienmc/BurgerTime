Loderunner Cycle 1 report and Cycle 2 plans:

Team #13          Members:Collin Trowbridge, Matthew O'Brien, Xinyu Xiao


CYCLE 1 REPORT:

Which user stories did your team successfully implement and test?
Opens help menu on click
Hero moves with keyboard input
Hero can see the pathway


Which stories were in your plans, but did not get done?  Describe the state of each.
burgers display and depress, burger class is almost implemented. Need to draw burgers.
hero stays within bounds of pathway. Hero and pathway are on screen, just need to implement collision detection.



What research experiments did your team do as you learn about technologies?
We learned about keybinding through stack overflow.
We learned about graphics through CSSE220 BallWorlds project.
We learned about design, and how it's almost constantly changing.


Briefly describe the main contributions of each team member during Cycle 1.
Matthew hardcoded the map and worked on graphics.
Collin worked on graphics and keyboard input.
Xinyu worked on grahpics, frames, and the burger class.

CYCLE 2 PLANS:
Draw burgers.
Finish our cycle 1 user stories (collision between hero and burgers, and collision between hero and pathway).
Guards have limited movement.

USER STORIES:

List the user stories that you plan to implement in Cycle 2:
Hero collides with burgers / depresses them.
Hero stays on the pathway.
Hero collides with guards. (possibly dies)

RESEARCH:   
What information/techniques does your team need to research, and who is assigned to investigate what?
Research collision detection with rectangles in java.
Each team member will investigate and then group discussion on how to implement.



MISC:
Describe any other aspects of your plans for cycle 2.
