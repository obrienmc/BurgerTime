Loderunner Cycle 2 report and Cycle 3 plans:

Team # 13         Members: Collin Trowbridge, Xinyu Xiao, Matthew O'Brien


CYCLE 2 REPORT:

Which user stories did your team successfully implement and test?
Draw burger set.
Collision between guards and hero, hero and pathway, guard and pathway.
Burgers depress and fall, don't stack yet or fall when hit by another burger.
Hero dies, lives are displayed below plates.
Hero can be invincible for 3 seconds (this is our version of pepper sprays).

Which stories were in your plans, but did not get done?  Describe the state of each.
Algorithmic guard movement. Guards move just randomly for now, cycle 3 will implement smart movement.


What research experiments did your team do as you learn about technologies?
Researched timers


Briefly describe the main contributions of each team member during Cycle 2.
Xinyu worked on the burgers colliding with the hero and falling.
Matthew and Collin worked on pepper sprays, map layout, collision detection, and graphics.


CYCLE 3 PLANS:
Write 3 more levels. Implement the up and down keys to change levels.
Level input handling from text files.
Food falls on guard, guard dies and resets position.
User runs out of lives, game ends. Begin from level 1 again.
User stacks all the burgers on the plates, wins level, level goes up.
Scoring interface implemented.


List the user stories that you plan to implement in Cycle 3:
User stacks burgers on the plates, causing them to win the level.
User runs out of lives, game over and the game resets.
User beats all of the levels, final score is displayed.
